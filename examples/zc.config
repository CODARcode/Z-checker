##numOfErrorBoundCases refers to the number of error bounds to be selected for presenatation in the statistical analysis of compression results, e.g., distribution of errors.
##Suppose there are totally 8 error bounds: 1E-1, 1E-2, 1E-3, ...., 1E-8.
##If numOfErrorBoundCases=3, then only 1E-1, 1E-4, and 1E-7 will be selected for the presetation of distribution of errors, auto-correlation and spectrum and so on.
