# Z-checker
a library to characterize the data and check the compression results of lossy compressors.

**We strongly recommend QCAT (https://github.com/szcompressor/qcat), a lightweight variant of Z-checker. Each metric is implemented as both a standalone executable and an API call.**

Z-checker-intaller can help you install everything (including compressors SZ and ZFP and other third-party libraries for plotting the figures). Z-checker-installer can be downloaded from http://github.com/CODARcode/z-checker-installer. Please read the user-guide of Z-checker for details.

This version supports CPU and MPI. If you are interested in the GPU version of Z-checker, please use cuZ-checker (https://github.com/CODARcode/cuZ-checker)

For quick data compression toolkit, you can use the qcat tool, which is included in this package. It can help you conveniently conduct data type conversion, file format conversion and quick data visualization, and compare the original data and decompressed data simply. The qcat library can also be found on github (https://github.com/szcompressor/qcat.git).

Please cite the following paper if you used Z-checker in your research/papers. Thanks!
