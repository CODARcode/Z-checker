#
# - This module locates an installed R distribution.
#
# Defines the following:
#  R_COMMAND           - Path to R command
#  R_HOME              - Path to 'R home', as reported by R
#  R_INCLUDE_DIR       - Path to R include directory
#  R_LIBRARY_BASE      - Path to R library
#  R_LIBRARY_BLAS      - Path to Rblas / blas library
#  R_LIBRARY_LAPACK    - Path to Rlapack / lapack library
#  R_LIBRARY_READLINE  - Path to readline library
#  R_LIBRARIES         - Array of: R_LIBRARY_BASE, R_LIBRARY_BLAS, R_LIBRARY_LAPACK, R_LIBRARY_BASE [, R_LIBRARY_READLINE]
#
#
# Variable search order:
#   1. Attempt to locate and set R_COMMAND
#     - If unsuccessful, generate error and prompt user to manually set R_COMMAND
#   2. Use R_COMMAND to set R_HOME
#   3. Locate other libraries in the priority:
#     1. Within a user-built instance of R at R_HOME
#     2. Within an installed instance of R
#     3. Within external system libraries
