\subsection{Rate Derivative Analysis}
%rate derivatives analysis

Rate derivative is a critical metric to assess the overall compression quality with respect to the derivatives metric. Similar to the rate distortion, \emph{rate} here is also known as \emph{bit-rate}, refering to the number of bits used to represent a data point on average after the compression (the smaller the better).
