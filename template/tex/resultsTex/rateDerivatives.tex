\subsection{Rate Derivative Analysis}
%rate derivatives analysis

Rate derivative is a critical metric to assess the overall compression quality with respect to the derivatives metric. Similar to the rate distortion, \emph{rate} here is also known as \emph{bit-rate}, refering to the number of bits used to represent a data point on average after the compression (the smaller the better). \emph{Derivative} has two types - first-order derivative and second-order derivative.

We calculate PSNR and SSIM of the derivatives to assess the compressio quality. Hence, there are totally four metrics, including PSNR over 1st-order derivative (called 1st-derivative-PSNR), PSNR over 2nd-order derivative (called 2nd-derivative-PSNR), SSIM over 1st-order derivative (called 1st-derivative-SSIM), SSIM over 2nd-order derivative (called 2nd-derivative-SSIM), respectively.

The rate derivative results are presented as follows.
