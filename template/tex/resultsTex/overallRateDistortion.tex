%overall rate distortion analysis

Overall rate distortion is calculated for each compressor based on all related variables, based on Formula (\ref{eq:overallPSNR}).

\def\formulaOverallPSNR{
	overall\_PSNR = -20 \log_{10}(overall\_NRMSE)
}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:overallPSNR}
  \formulaOverallPSNR
\end{equation}

\def\formulaOverallNRMSE{
	overall\_NRMSE = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{var_i} NRMSE^2(var_i)}{N}}
}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:overallNRMSE}
  \formulaOverallNRMSE
\end{equation}
where \emph{var}$_i$ refers to a variable (a.k.a., field), and $N$ is the number of variables.

The overall rate distortion results are presented in Figure \ref{fig:overall-rate-distortion_psnr}.
