\subsection{Rate Distortion Analysis}
%rate distortion analysis

Rate distortion is a critical metric to assess the overall compression quality. As for rate-distortion, \emph{rate} is also known as \emph{bit-rate}, refering to the number of bits used to represent a data point on average after the compression (the smaller the better). \emph{Distortion} is assessed using \emph{peak signal-to-noise ratio} (PSNR), which is a common criterion to assess the overall compression error (the higher the better).

The rate distortion results are presented in Figure \ref{fig:rate-distortion_psnr}.
