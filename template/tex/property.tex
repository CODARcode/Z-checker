\section{Property of Data}
%data property

In this assessment, there are totally ZC_VARNUM variables, which are ZC_VARLIST, respectively. 
The basic properties of the data (incuding minimal value, maximal value, entropy, etc.) are presented in Table \ref{tab:propAnalysis}.

The auto-correlation results with different lags (1 through 100) are presented in Figure \ref{fig:dp-autocorr}.
The amplitude values of the spectrum analysis (based on FFT) are presented in FIgure \ref{fig:dp-fft-amp}. Since the amplitude value of the first spectrum coefficient is often much larger than others, we present its value on the left-corner of each figure instead of showing its bar in the figure.
