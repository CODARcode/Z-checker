\begin{abstract}
The objective of this report is to show the compression quality and distortion of the data based on one or more lossy compressors, including ZcCompressors. 
It includes the information about the data properties (such as min value, max value, entropy, auto-correlation, spectrum) and lossy compressoin quality, 
such as compression factor, distribution of compression errors, auto-correlation of compression errors, distortion of the data (i.e., PSNR), distortion 
of the spectrum, rate-distortion analysis, compression rate, and decompression rate. This report is generated by Z-checker.
